## Unix Wargames FAQ

### What is the Unix Wargames Project?

The goal of the Unix Wargames Project is to provide an environment for use by
novice and experienced Unix/Linux users and adminitrators for educational purposes.

The approach we take to teaching you some Unix/Linux is by playing a game,
where you, the player would have to solve a task using the Unix/Linux
command-line tools.

The more you advance in the game the more familiar you will be with the Unix/Linux system,
the tools, and the philosophy of Unix!

Working on Unix/Linux is supposed to be fun, and by this game
we try to bring some fun and entertainment in your journey with Unix!

Hope you enjoy it!

### Do I need to have any programming experience in order to play the game?

No.

Every level of the Unix Wargames can be completed only by using the standard
Unix/Linux command-line tools.

The goal of the game is to get you familiar with the Unix/Linux tools and how to master them.

Of course you are free to improvise and use your programming skills as well if you like doing so!

### How is the game organized?

The game is organized into different levels (or how we call them -- **chapters**), and at
each chapter you will be presented with a challenge you need to solve.

The goal of each chapter is to retrieve the secret key,
which is the key that unlocks the next chapter. 

We start off with simple and easy tasks and by introducing the
tools that you will use most of time while working on a Unix/Linux system.

With each new chapter we will be introducing new tools and concepts,
which will be required for you to learn and understand in order
to advance to the next chapter.

At each chapter you will find a *"chapterNN.txt"* file in your home
directory, which contains instructions and hints of the task
you need to perform.

We will also be providing hints on how the task could be approached.
The hints could be which commands to use, could be a story,
a file's name, or even the chapter's name could be the hint as well!

So, make sure to read the chapter's story carefully and understand the hints! :)

### What do I need to get started with the game?

The game is played over [SSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) and all you need
in order to get started is an SSH client.

If you are running a Unix/Linux system you should already have an SSH client installed.

Windows users can use [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) as their SSH client.

To get started with the game you need to first [register an account](http://wargames.unix-heaven.org/forums/ucp.php?mode=register).

Once you create your account you will receive an email with all the details for your first challenge!

### I'm stuck on a chapter, please help!

If you get stuck on a chapter, don't worry and don't give up!

Most of the time the tasks you need to complete are very simple, but they could
not be so obvious to solve at first look. So look again and try again!

If nothing else works for you after all, please check the [forums](http://wargames.unix-heaven.org/forums/index.php),
we will try to give you a hint and put you in the right direction! :)

## The Man(ual) pages

In almost every chapter you will see references like *"cmd(1)"*.

This is a reference to a Unix/Linux man(ual) page, which you should
look into and read. A man(ual) page reference contains the command name and
a section of the manual page.

In the above example with *"cmd(1)"* the command name is *"cmd"* and the man page
section is *1*. And here is how you can view the man page for *"cmd(1)"*:

        $ man 1 cmd

As this game is about teaching you Unix/Linux, be prepared for some reading! :)

## I want to contribute a new chapter to the Unix Wargames, how do I do that?

details about the new chapter.

We will contact you back soon enough.
